# Auto Window System for Mercedes SLK 230

## Overview
This project implements an automatic window control system for a Mercedes SLK 230. The system is designed to automatically roll down the windows when the car door is opened and roll them up when the door is closed.

## Features
- Automatic window control based on door signals.
- Utilizes interrupts for efficient door signal detection.
- Status LED indicates the current action (window movement).

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- H-bridge motor driver module (for controlling window motors)
- Mercedes SLK 230 door signal sensors

## Installation
1. Connect the door signal sensors to the corresponding input pins on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the H-bridge motor driver module to the window motor control pins.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`auto_window_system.ino`) to the Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Open the car door to trigger the system to roll down the windows.
2. Close the car door to trigger the system to roll up the windows.
3. The status LED will indicate the current action:
   - LED ON: Window is moving down.
   - LED OFF: Window is moving up.

## Configuration
- The duration for window movement (up and down) can be adjusted by modifying the `WINDOW_MOVE_DURATION_UP` and `WINDOW_MOVE_DURATION_DOWN` constants in the Arduino sketch.
